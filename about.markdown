TODO: Add links to certs
-->
My name is Sammy Tbeile. I'm a New Yorker, DnD enthusiast, and Security lover. I have a variety of certs including OSCP, Comptia Security+ and Cysa+ certs and AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate. In this blog I'll post some walkthroughs to things that seem fun. Hope you enjoy!
